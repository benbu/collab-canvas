# Performance Monitoring Guide

## Overview

The performance monitoring system has been integrated into the Collab Canvas app to help identify performance bottlenecks, particularly around:
- **Firestore sync operations** (writes, reads, throttling, batch operations)
- **Unified presence sync** (cursor + character combined)
- **2D character physics**
- Shape editing and rendering
- Auto-pan camera
- General FPS tracking

## Recent Optimizations

### Batch Write Implementation
- **Group Operations**: Multiple shape updates (drag, z-index, text edits) now use batch writes
- **Benefit**: Reduces N writes to 1 batch write (up to 500 operations per batch)
- **Impact**: Significantly reduces Firestore write operations during multi-shape operations

### Unified Presence Sync
- **Combined**: Cursor and character sync merged into single presence document
- **Benefit**: ~50% reduction in presence-related writes (was 2 separate writes, now 1)
- **Throttle**: 50ms (~20 FPS) balances character physics with network efficiency
- **Idle Detection**: Skips writes when both cursor and character are idle

## How to Enable

### In Development Mode
Click the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Perf" button in the bottom-left DevTools panel to enable performance monitoring.

### In Production
Add `?perf=true` to the URL:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/room/your-room?perf=true
```

The monitoring state persists in localStorage, so you only need to enable it once per browser.

## Using the Performance Monitor

### Enable and View
1. Click **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Perf"** to enable monitoring (button turns green: **"‚è∏Ô∏è Perf"**)
2. Click **"üëÅÔ∏è Show"** to display the performance overlay
3. The overlay appears in the top-right corner showing real-time metrics

### Performance Overlay Sections

#### FPS Display
- **Green (‚â•55 FPS)**: Excellent performance
- **Orange (30-54 FPS)**: Moderate performance
- **Red (<30 FPS)**: Poor performance, optimization needed

- **Writes**: Time spent writing to Firestore
  - Includes add, update, updateImmediate, batchUpdate, remove operations
  - **Batch writes** now used for group operations (multiple shapes)
- **Reads**: Time spent processing Firestore snapshots
- **Throttled**: Count of operations that were throttled (prevented due to rate limiting)

#### üéØ Presence Sync (Unified)
- **Sync**: Time spent syncing combined cursor + character presence to/from Firestore
  - Writes are throttled to ~20 FPS (50ms)
  - Includes idle detection to skip unnecessary writes

### Statistics Display
For each category, you'll see:
- **Count (Nx)**: Number of times the operation occurred
- **avg**: Average duration in milliseconds
- **max**: Maximum (slowest) duration
- **last**: Most recent duration

## Exporting Performance Data

1. Click **"üíæ Export"** to download a detailed JSON report
2. The report includes:
   - All timing statistics
   - Recent timing entries (last 50 operations)
   - Operation counts
   - Current FPS

Example filename: `perf-report-1729388400000.json`

## Clearing Data

Click **"üóëÔ∏è Clear"** to reset all collected performance data and start fresh.

## What to Look For

### High Firestore Write Times
- **Symptom**: Firestore Writes showing >50ms average (individual writes) or >100ms (batch writes)
- **Causes**: Network latency, too frequent updates, large payloads, large batches
- **Solutions**: 
  - Increase throttle interval
  - Reduce data being synced
  - Use batch operations for group updates (already implemented)
  - Split very large batches (>100 shapes) into smaller ones

### High Firestore Throttled Count
- **Symptom**: Many operations being throttled
- **Indicates**: Update frequency exceeds throttle interval (80ms for shapes, 50ms for presence)
- **Solutions**:
  - Review update frequency
  - Consider debouncing rapid changes
  - Verify idle detection is working for presence sync

### Batch Write Efficiency
- **Look for**: `batchUpdate-N-shapes` markers in performance data
- **Optimal**: Multiple shape operations should use single batch write
- **Check**: Group drag, text edits, z-index operations should show batch writes when >1 shape selected

### Low FPS with High Character Physics Time
- **Symptom**: Physics operations taking >10ms
- **Causes**: Too many shapes for collision detection
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement spatial partitioning
  - Optimize collision detection algorithms
  - Reduce collision check radius

### High Shape Edit Times
- **Symptom**: Shape edit operations taking >5ms
- **Causes**: Complex selection logic, frequent re-renders
- **Solutions**:
  - Optimize selection management
  - Add memoization
  - Reduce effect dependencies

## Testing Scenarios

### Baseline Performance
1. Enable monitoring
2. Clear data
3. Create 10-20 shapes
4. Monitor FPS and operation times

### Stress Test
1. Use "Seed 500" button to create 500 shapes
2. Watch Firestore Write times
3. Create a character and test physics
4. Monitor collision detection times

### Real-time Collaboration
1. Open the same room in multiple tabs/browsers
2. Edit shapes simultaneously
3. Monitor Firestore Read times
4. Check for write conflicts and throttling

### Character Physics
1. Create a character
2. Place several platforms (rectangles)
3. Jump between platforms
4. Monitor Physics and Collision timings

## Browser DevTools Integration

The performance markers use the standard Performance API, so you can:

1. Open Chrome DevTools > Performance tab
2. Record a session
3. Look for User Timing markers like:
   - `fs-update-*` (Firestore individual writes)
   - `fs-batch-update-*` (Firestore batch writes)
   - `fs-snapshot` (Firestore reads)
   - `char-physics` (Character physics)
   - `presence-sync-write` (Unified presence sync writes)
   - `presence-sync-snapshot` (Unified presence sync reads)
   - `upsert-handler` (Shape edits)
   - `auto-pan` (Camera panning)
   - `viewport-culling` (Shape visibility optimization)

## Troubleshooting

### Monitor Not Showing
- Check that you've clicked both "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Perf" (enable) and "üëÅÔ∏è Show" (display)
- In production, ensure `?perf=true` is in URL

### No FPS Data
- FPS tracking starts when monitoring is enabled
- Give it a few seconds to collect frame data

### Operations Not Being Tracked
- Ensure performance monitoring is enabled before performing operations
- Some operations only occur during specific actions (character physics only runs when character is active)

## Performance Targets

Based on the plan success criteria and recent optimizations:

- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS (‚â•55 is acceptable)
- **Firestore Individual Write**: <20ms average
- **Firestore Batch Write**: <50ms average (for batches <10 shapes), <100ms (for larger batches)
- **Firestore Read**: <10ms average
- **Presence Sync Write**: <30ms average (unified cursor + character)
- **Character Physics**: <5ms average (with <100 shapes)
- **Shape Edit**: <2ms average
- **Auto-pan**: <1ms average

### Expected Write Reduction
With the batch write and unified presence optimizations:
- **Presence writes**: Reduced by ~50% (2 separate writes ‚Üí 1 combined write)
- **Group operations**: Reduced by ~95% for multi-shape operations (N individual writes ‚Üí 1 batch write)
- **Example**: Dragging 10 shapes previously required 10 writes, now requires only 1 batch write

## Next Steps

After collecting performance data:

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Look for operations with high avg/max times or low FPS
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most frequent or slowest operations
3. **Optimize**: Implement targeted optimizations based on findings
4. **Measure**: Re-test with monitoring to verify improvements
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until performance targets are met
