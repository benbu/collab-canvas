# Active Context

## Current focus
- All MVP PRs (#1â€“#12) completed
- Post-MVP tweaks: z-index fixes (toolbar/dev panel above canvas), README deployment section

## Recent changes
- Loader until snapshot hydration and Firestore sync ready
- Deterministic cursor colors and labels
- Touch pinch-zoom basics
- DEV seed (500 rects) + FPS measurement
- Deployment artifacts: firebase.json, firestore.rules, vercel.json

## Next steps
- Optional: deeper UX polish, code splitting, perf profiling
- Optional: README enhancements, Contributing guide

## Decisions
- Keep MVP security rules permissive (auth required), harden later
